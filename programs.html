        <h3>PREPARING INMATES FOR TRANSITION</h3>
        <p>Halo understands the anxiety inmates face as their release date approaches; the problems awaiting prisoners on the outside can be overwhelming. For years inmates are told when to eat, go to bed, shower, how to dress, and where to go. Suddenly
            the power to make decisions will fall on the inmate. At Halo, we are committed to preparing inmates to transition to their community with a hope filled outlook. The Halo transition program utilizes a combination of mentoring, parenting classes,
            work readiness training, and other programs aimed at empowerment through hard work and education. We work with ex-offenders to position them to be thriving members of their communities. <a href="transition.html">LEARN MORE</a></p>

          <h3>Ex-Offender Services</h3>
          <p>At Halo, we understand the difficulty ex-offenders face when employment seeking.  Every day things most of us take for granted such as, personal grooming, proper attire, and interview skills are often overlooked when inmates transition back to their communities.

          <p>Halo's goal is to assist families with an incarcerated parent through empowerment programs aimed at strengthening the familial bond during the inmate's incarceration and after the transition from prison.<a href="family.html">LEARN MORE</a></p>

          <h3>Halo's Children Project</h3>
          <p>Through our community outreach, we have witnessed firsthand the strain on relationships between inmates and children caused by incarceration. Halo's Children Project aims to become the area's largest outreach program specifically for the children of inmates. <a href="kids.html">LEARN MORE</a></p>

        <p>While in prison, Rick enrolled in Haloâ€™s development and life-skills program where he learned how to create resumes and a business plan, and, through the positive affirmation, and self-help materials he studied in prison, Rick improved his leadership skills.  After Rick's release from prison, Halo's volunteers connected him with a business owner
          who served as a mentor in Rick's effort to bring the business plan he developed behind bars to fruition.  Rick now operates his own small business and employs other ex-offenders committed to making a positive impact in their community.  Rick continues to meet with his mentor, who's been with him through it all.  Rick attributes his success to the
        assistance from Halo, the transition, preparation, and business owner who was willing to give him guidance.  Rick has committed himself to becoming a leader in his commmunity, his desire is that more employers will make a choice to hire ex-offenders.  Rick has also begun working with teens in an effort to put them on the right path <i>before</i> they are incarcerated.</p>
