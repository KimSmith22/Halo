  <h2><b>HALO'S APPROACH</b></h2>
  <p>Halo's mission is to empower communities affected by incarceration by working with prisoners and their families to increase the familial bond during and after incarceration.  Our
  goal is to maintain the bond between the inmate and their support system through programs aimed at keeping the lines of communication open.  Halo's focus is to provide an area of support
for the inmate by alleviating the worry inmates feel related to the ancillary care of the spouses and children affected by incarceration.  Halo works with inmates to prepare for the transition
from prison back into the community by offering mental health and/or drug and alcohol treatment referrals, work readiness training, wardrobe assistance, and personal grooming services which assist in obtainig employment.
Halo works with families by providing support in the forgotten areas such as birthday gifts for a child of an inmate. Halo provides community referrals for families to assist in alleviating the stress
incarceration places on those left behind.  After release, Halo continues to provide support for the family unit to aide in building a strong family unit.</p>

    <h3>RESTORING FAMILIES</h3>
    <p>Halo Foundation understands how parental incarceration causes a ripple effect as the disruption of family relationships produces negative outcomes for children, including poverty, poor academic performance, aggression, depression, delinquency, and
      substance abuse. These factors perpetuate the demise of communities, and contribute to the systematic destruction of minority families as incarcerated mothers and fathers are unable to work on parenting skills necessary for reunification. The
      resulting separation interferes with the ability of parents and children to form and maintain a strong attachment. We offer family-centered services for incarcerated parents, their children, and families through strengthening activities, nurturing
      of family relationships, community supports for families during incarceration, and for the incarcerated parent following release.</p>

    <h3>HELPING INMATES</h3>
    <p>Halo staff and volunteers utilize a holistic approach when helping inmates during and after incarceration.  Halo provides mentorship opportunities, parenting classes, life-skills and job training classes as part of our transition program. During incarceration
    Halo will work with the inmate to understand his or her unique situation.  Halo will build a rapport with the inmate to serve as a bridge to the family during incarceration.  Halo will provide prison approved teaching materials to the inmate aimed at self-reflection,
    parenting skills, self-affirmation, and educational material designed to provide a preliminary basis to support post incarceration education.  Halo's goal is to transform ex-offenders into community leaders by working to thwart barriers to success.</p>
