        <h2><b>HALO'S MISSION</b></h2>
        <p>Halo Rebuilders of America is an independent living program providing supportive living to individuals returning to their communities
        from federal prison.  Our oubjective is to restore, rebuild, and renew each life one step at a time.  Each client will be treated with a
        sense fo dignity and respect.  Halo's team of professionals believes in a wholistic approach; our team will help each client remaster self-
        management skills and re-integrate back into our communities.</p>
        <h3><b>WHY WE HELP PRISONERS</b></h3>

        <img src="images\stats.png" style="width: 100%" alt="statistical data">

        <P>
            <h3 class="red"><b>TRINA WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON SIX MONTHS AGO....</b></h3> While incarerated, Trina made a choice to better herself. She worked on self-improvement by indentifying how her poor choices landed her in prison. Trina is ready to reunite with her family, and the opportunity for a fresh start. Unfortunately,
            every opportunity disappears once people find out about Trina's past. Trina often wonders, "Will anyone ever give me the opportunity to prove I've changed?"</P>

        <p>
            <h3 class="red"><b>BOBBY'S DAD HAS BEEN IN PRISON FOR TWO YEARS, AND HIS MOM STRUGGLES TO MAKE ENDS MEET....</b></h3> Bobby sits alone at school so the other kids won't tease him about his dad. Bobby is angry his dad is in prison, it makes him sad to know he is not able to see his father and talk with him about what is going on in his life.</p>

        <p>
            <h3 class="red"><b>MARK HAS BEEN IN PRISON FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOR HIS ROLE IN A ROBBERY....</b></h3> He will be getting out of prison soon and is excited to reunite with his wife and children. Mark is unsure of what his life will be like without his involvement in crime. As he gets closer to his release date, Mark wishes there was someone
            outside of the prison system he could work with to ease the stress of his transition from prison. He has seen too many people return to prison because they were not able to handle the stress of going home. Mark does not want to be one of these
            people, he is committed to restoring his ties to his family and community.</p>
        <br>
        <p>More than half a million men and women are released from the prison system each year. Each of these people return to communites around the country and struggle to put the puzzle pieces of life back together. Not all will succeed. Trina, Bobby,
            and Mark are not just stories, they are real people, you may even know them or someone like them, it may even be you.</p>


    </div>
    <div class="footer view">
        <h4 class="red"><b>TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF PRISONERS, THEIR FAMILIES, AND OUR COMMUNITIES</b></h4>
        <p>What if you could help Trina as she works toward becoming a contributing member of her community? What if you could give Bobby a gift for his birthday or at Christmas from his dad so he knows how much his father misses and loves him?</p>
